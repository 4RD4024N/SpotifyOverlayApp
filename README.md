As someone who loves to play games, I spend most of my time on the computer. And when I do, I love listening to music. However, this morning, after upgrading my computer from Windows 10 to Windows 11, I started to feel a significant absence. The little thing in the top left that used to pop up and down when I changed songs or increased or decreased the volume was gone. But don't worry, this simple app will use the Spotify app's title to give you the information you need without requiring any API. It's currently in development, and a faster, more accurate version using the Spotify API, which will also display information like the song's album cover, will be available soon.
